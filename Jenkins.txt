Jenkins Pipeline 
    How to create a jenkins pipeline job ?
	1. We can add pipeline configuration in 2 ways 
		a. We write all the configuration inside the pipeline job in job ui only.
		b. We can write all the configuration in a file called Jenkinsfile and we can add that 
		   from a SCM/Version control 
	2. We are using only declarative pipeline type in our company.


    What are the ways to create a jenkins Job ?  
    What is a Jenkinsfile ?

    Jenkinsfile	
	- It is the file in which we write all our job configuration in groovy.
	- In our company we are using declarative pipeline in Jenkinsfile and we are maintaining 
	  Jenkinsfile through git.	

    Types of pipeline jobs 
	Jenkins pipeline uses Groovy scripting which 
	is one of the java based scripting language. 
	
	2 types of pipeline job 
	    1. Scripted pipeline 
		- Traditional way of defining pipeline Job 
 		- Most of the configuration we need to define manually. 
		- All the code will be inside node block.
			node {
				......
			}
	
 	    2. Declarative Pipeline  	
		- New way of defining pipeline job.
		- Most of the configuration are pre-defined.					 			   
		- All the code will be inside pipeline block.
			pipeline {
				......
			}


Agent
	- An agent is a declarative used to define the execution method for pipeline stages.
	- agent is the one which tell stages to execute on which node and its executor.
	- Agent can be specified at two levels 
				a. pipeline level 
				b. Stage level
		
	Types of agent 
		any 
			- This is the default agent, If I wont specify any agent this will be considered.
			- Runs the pipeline stages on any available node executor.
			
		none 
			-  To define executor for each and every stage declare agent as none at pipeline level.
			-  Using this we specify Jenkins that agent is controlled at each stage level.
			-  Defining agent at stage level is mandatory. 
				
		label 
			- we can define agent as label at pipeline to run all the stages of pipeline
			  on a particular node with label.
